# ProtoDUNE-BSM Data Processing Tools

This document provides an outline of the data processing tools developed or employed for the ProtoDUNE-BSM project, focusing on the tools used within the DAQ and LArSoft frameworks. These tools are designed to assist in data filtering, waveform and trigger primitive event visualization and track recontruction, enhancing the analysis and interpretation of experimental data.

At this moment, tools are devoted to finding interactions of neutrinos generated upstream in the T2 target and TAX in the ProtoDUNE-HD detector, also known as NP-04 module, located in the neutrino platform at CERN.

## DAQ framework

One of the major developments in the ProtoDUNE-BSM project is the implementation of a set of tools within the DAQ framework to facilitate data processing and event visualization. These tools are designed to streamline the analysis of raw data files, enabling researchers to extract relevant information and identify interesting events for further study.

More information about the setup, tools and their usage can be found in the [README_evd.md](README_evd.md) file.

## LArSoft framework
